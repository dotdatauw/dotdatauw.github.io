dotData DatData Science Club is a UW Madison student organization focused on promoting education and discussion around data science, big data, and machine learning technologies and practices. We believe that real-world data science involves an interdisciplinary approach involving computer science, statistical analysis, and domain expertise. We aim to inspire, teach, and connect with students across campus, regardless of major or department, discovering how this growing field fits into their interests and careers.

To do so, we host seminars & networking events throughout the semester by faculty and professionals working on interdisciplinary, data-driven projects spanning sociology, finance, biology, public health, and many other fields. Together, we find and share the most effective resources for learning, then share or talk about them. We also perform walkthroughs of interesting data technologies like web-scraping with Python or using a Twitter API to gain actionable data. Moving forward, we would like to better network students with faculty, companies, and each other on new ventures, from Kaggle competitions to semester-long research projects to internships and jobs (and free food).
